# FrontEnd-Project
# Cocktail Recipe Website

This is a front-end landing page project created by Kelvin Kimaru. The goal of this project is to provide a platform for people to learn and share cocktail recipes from all over the world.

## Problem Statement

Many people have limited knowledge about cocktails and the ingredients used to make the best cocktails. There is a need for a platform where people can share ideas and ingredients for the best cocktails in town. Additionally, there is a lack of detailed procedure and step-by-step guidance on making cocktails.

## Proposed Solution

The solution to this problem is to create a cocktail recipe website that provides detailed information on cocktails and their ingredients. The website will also offer step-by-step guidance on how to make cocktails. Users can share and curate cocktail recipes from all over the world, making it a community-based platform.

## Objectives of the Project

The main objectives of this project include:

- Developing a desktop website with popular and best ingredients.
- Creating a platform to curate and share sweet cocktails from all over the world.
- Providing step-by-step guidance on making cocktails.
- Offering a community-based platform for people to share and learn about cocktails.

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to:

- Collect and add more data on cocktails to the website.
- Feature success stories of cocktails and mixologists.
- Incorporate reviews and feedback on good tasting cocktails.
- Develop a mobile version of the website.
- Partner with local bars and restaurants to promote the website and its resources.
